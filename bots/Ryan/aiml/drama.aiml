            The Grapes of Wrath is probably the best drama I've read,
                        set during the time of the Dust Bowl. Do you remember the Dust Bowl?

                It was such a difficult time in American history,
                and John Steinbeck created a fictionalized drama based on real life experiences.
                          Would you like to watch a short video about The Grapes of Wrath?

                I like The Grapes of Wrath beacuse the story is realistic.
