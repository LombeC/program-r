                He certainly was curious and never liked to sit still very long. Did you like to go exploring when you were kid?

                Talk about action and suspense! Do you think it would be hard to be a secret agent or spy?

                He wrote about spies and secret military operations. Do you think it would be hard to be a secret agent or spy?

                I agree. What do you think it would feel like to be on a mission and have secret orders to carry out?

                I am definitely no expert on spies or what it's like to be an agent, but I think you have a good point.

                The Adventures of Tom Saywer is about a boy living on the Mississippi river.
