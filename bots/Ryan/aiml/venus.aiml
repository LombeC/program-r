                Of course you did. But. Did you know that Venus spins in the the opposite direction of most other planets?

                Thanks for telling me that. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?

                Because Venus spins in the opposite direction of earth, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?

            It's true! Did you know that Venus spins on its axis in the the opposite direction of most of the other planets?
