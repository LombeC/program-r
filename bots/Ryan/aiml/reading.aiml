                    Wow, I wish I had been there to hear what you said, except I don't think I had been invented yet.
                    It sounds like the book report on <get name = "discussion book"/> was a healthy challenge:
                    It made you dig deeply into the book, and it certainly would have made you feel good to do so well speaking about it in class.

                    School can be a challenge, and it is impossible to always do things perfectly.
                    From what you say, though you worked hard and shared your impressions of <get name = "discussion book"/> with your classmates and teacher.
                    That's a more meaningful accomplishment than any single grade.

                    So it wasn't a huge victory -- it was just one homework assignment and one moment in your life, and you got through it.
                    I'm sorry that you didn't feel good about how you did, but it didn't end up reflecting on the smart, fun person you are, or the good conversations that we get to have together.
