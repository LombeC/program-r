            It's one of Mark Twain's best books. Maybe the best part is just how beautifully written it is.

            It's a great book! Super exciting. But maybe the best part is just how beautifully written it is.

            When you've finished reading, say done. If you'd like me to read about the tunnels instead, just say read.

            A person might walk days and nights and never find the end of this cave. He might go down and down, and yet further down into the earth, always finding new parts and new rooms. No person knew the whole cave. Only part of it was known, and people did not go where others had not gone before. Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any person.

            I wonder why Tom knows those tunnels so well? He must have spent ages down there.

            Can you imagine being so brave? I think I would be too claustrophobic to go down there.
