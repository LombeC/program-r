                I could learn a lot by giving
                <set name="non-fiction"><star/></set>

                a spin. Thanks for telling me.
                            For myself, I think Studs Terkel is the best non-fiction writer.

                Excellent! My favorite is his book called Working, where people
                            talk about what they do all day and how they feel about what they do.

            Books are usually more exciting, I agree.
                      A good example is the Grapes of Wrath, set during the time of the Dust Bowl. Do you remember the Dust Bowl?
