                I could learn a lot by giving
                <set name="non-fiction"><star/></set>

                a spin. Thanks for telling me.
                            For myself, I think Studs Terkel is the best non-fiction writer.

            Books are usually more exciting, I agree.
                      A good example is the Grapes of Wrath, set during the time of the Dust Bowl.
