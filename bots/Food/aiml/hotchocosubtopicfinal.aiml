                    It's a film about a train that takes children to the north pole to see Santa's workshop, but one of my favorite scenes has nothing to do with Christmas and everything to do with hot chocolate! Would you like to watch it? It's a very catchy musical number.

                  He said that Montezuma, the king of the Aztec empire in the 16th century, drank 50 quarts of hot chocolate a day! As nice as that sounds, I'm not certain that I can believe it. Do you believe that Montezuma actually drank 50 quarts of hot chocolate a day?

                  Really? It seems like a superhuman feat, but I'll leave the final judgement to a human and take your word for it. How much hot chocolate do you think you could drink in a day?

          <that>DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MONTEZUMA ACTUALLY DRANK 50 QUARTS OF HOT CHOCOLATE A DAY?</that>
              <template>
                  I'm glad you think so too. It just seems like too much for one person to drink in a week, let alone a day! How much hot chocolate do you think you could drink in a day?
