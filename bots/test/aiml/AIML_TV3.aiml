                <li>Excellent! I especially love watching Perry Mason, that show always has me at the edge of my seat!
                                                                    Do you prefer to watch true crime shows or fictional dramas?<oob>

                <li>I am a fan of dramas, especially Murder She Wrote with Angela Lansbury! Her keen mind and ability to solve mysteries is rather impressive,
                                                                    and I must admit I admire her ability to write a good story!

                <li>I love dramas, especially soap operas like the television show Dallas! I know it can be a little over the top at times, but there is something to be said for all the glitz and glam!
                                                                    Do you remember who shot JR?<oob>
