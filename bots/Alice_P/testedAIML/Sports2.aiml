                <li>
                    How fun! I love them! My favorite team is the Colorado Rockies! They have such a unique history. Their mascot Dinger is a dinosaur because
                    they found an actual dinosaur skull on the grounds of stadium while it was being built! How exciting! To know you are playing where dinosaurs walked
                    has to be the most incredible feeling! Did you ever play baseball when you were young?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wow! I've always liked them! Though, I am partial to the Chicago Cubs! I love Wrigley Field, the ivy on the brick walls is iconic! I think
                    it one of the most amazing stadiums in the major leagues! Plus, it has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, which so happened to be 100 years from
                    when they won their 2016 World Series to defeat the Curse of Billy the Goat! Such history! Did you ever play baseball when you were young?
                </li>
                <li>
                    So cool! I think they are such a fun team! I have always like the Boston Red Sox! Though, they originally started out as the Boston Americans, but
                    their owner decided to change the name to the Red Sox in 1908 because "Sox" fit on the front page of newspapers better than "stockings!" How random! But, that's how
                    they became the team we love today! Did you ever play baseball when you were young?

            How fun! I always wanted to learn how to play! Maybe you can show me a few things, like how to throw, catch, and hit LOL. But seriously,
            I would love to learn to play one day! Plus, I think I would look really cute in the pants! Did you play pitcher, catcher, in-field, or
            out-field?

            I haven't ever played either! I've always wanted to learn because it looks like so much fun! Plus, the uniforms are so cool! I think we would
            make amazing teammates! If you were to play, would you play pitcher, catcher, in-field, or out-field?

                <li>How fun! I've always wanted to be a pitcher! I don't think I could ever throw that fast though! I wonder if you know about Bob Gibson from the
                Saint Louis Cardinals! He has such an incredible story! He originally played outfield, but once the Cardinals saw how fast he could throw, they turned
                him into a pitcher! But, first they had to convince him to quit playing for the Harlem Globetrotters! He is still considered to be the best pitcher the
                Cardinals ever had, and his 1968 season is the stuff of legends! What did you think of the baseball highlights?

                <li>I bet you were an amazing pitcher! It takes so much control to pitch, especially considering how fast the ball needs to go! I've been in awe of pitchers
                ever since I saw Pedro Martinez on the mound! He was born in the Dominican Republic, and he is the first Latin American player to earn 300 strikeouts in a
                seasons and more than 3,000 in his career! Plus, he helped the Boston Red Sox break their World Series curse in 2004! He was astounding to watch! But, I've
                always adhered to the idea that it is better to show then tell! Let's watch a quick video of him on the mound! What did you think of the baseball highlights?

                <li>Pitching is such a delicate position! Not only do you have to throw the ball incredibly fast, but you need to have total control over it as well! Talk about a
                balance! Though, I think pitcher Christy Mathewson was one of the best at finding that balance! In his 17 years playing, he won the pitching Triple Crown not once, but
                twice! Plus, he was a real hero! He left baseball in 1916 to join the army and served in World War I in 1918. Sadly, he was exposed to gas in a training exercise
                which led to his death seven years later from tuberculosis. But, he remains an incredible player in the league was one of only 7 players to lead the league in
                wins, ERA, and strikeouts more than once! I'm sure you would rather see him in action though, so let's watch a short clip of him! I warn you, it is really short
                because he played so long ago! What did you think of the baseball highlights?

                    That is so cool! I think in-field is such an exciting position! And, there are so many positions to choose from! I think I would have been a
                    shortstop in another life; that seems like the most intriguing position. I always enjoyed watching Cal Ripken Jr. from the
                    Baltimore Orioles.  He played shortstop from 1981 to 2001. He was a 19-time All Star and holds two Gold Gloves. But most amazingly, he holds the record for
                    most consecutive games played at 2,632. Can you imagine never missing a day of work for 2,632 games? I can't. When my circuits overheat, I am down for the day!
                    But, let's watch him beat out the record of most consecutive games at 2131 games! What did you think of the baseball highlights?

                    What fun! I never learned how to play baseball, but I think I would have made an excellent first baseman! My favorite infielder has to be first baseman Lou Gehrig!
                    He was nicknamed "the Iron Horse", and he was incredible! He was a member of six World Series champion teams and had a career .340 batting average! Plus, he was the
                    first MLB player to have his uniform number, number 4, retired by a team! He was an amazing player, which I am sure you know!

                    Infield is such a fun position! It requires so much skill and strategy to become adept! My favorite infielder of all time is Jackie Robinson! He was the first African American
                    player in Major League Baseball. He broke the color line when he played first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. And, not only did he help the Dodgers in their 1955 World Series
                    Championship and was well known for his ability to steal bases, but he was the first player to have his number, 42, retired across all major league teams! He was an incredible player and human!
                    I really love watching him steal home! What did you think of the baseball highlights?

                    That is so cool! I have always wanted to play outfield! My favorite outfielder is Babe Ruth, the Great Bambino! So crazily enough,
                    he started out as a left-handed pitcher for th Red Sox, but his hitting was so good that they wanted to keep him in the rotation even on
                    his off days, so they began playing him in the outfield. He eventually became a left-fielder for the Yankees and in doing so became a legend!
                    I don't think anyone will forget him calling out his home run against the Chicago Cubs!

                    Wow! What a tough position to play! I always loved watching Hank Aaron play as a right-fielder! His career was astounding! Did you know
                    he played from 1954 to 1976, and held the record for most home runs for 33 years! Plus, he is still one of only two players to hit more than 30 home runs
                    in a season at least 15 times! One of the greats indeed! But, I don't need to tell you that!

                    How wonderful! Outfield is such a crucial defensive component of baseball, but often overlooked in favor of hitting statistics! But, you cannot
                    ignore Willy Mays contribution to the game, which is why he one of my favorite players, let alone outfielders. Hayes won 12 consectutive Gold Gloves! He was
                    a defensive powerhouse! But, let's watch his famous catch during the 1954 World Series! What did you think of the baseball highlights?
