            Naan is so good you can almost taste how dangerous it is to make. Well... Perhaps dangerous isn't the right word. Do you know how naan is made?

            Traditionally, naan is prepared in a clay oven that is heated to a very high temperature. The chef has to reach their whole arm in to the oven to place the naan on the wall of the oven. That's some commitment.
