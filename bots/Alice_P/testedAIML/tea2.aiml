                  That's a good choice! Black tea makes you seem very refined, like British Royalty. Speaking of British royalty, would you like to learn about the person who made tea drinking fashionable?

                  It was a protest by early American colonists against British taxation, in which they dumped a bunch of tea in Boston Harbor. Does that spark your memory?

                  I'm generally opposed to violence, but I have a very specific question in mind. Something like 350 chests of tea were dumped in the water by the angry colonists. Do you think it made the water in the harbor taste like tea?

                      I don't know one way or another, but I think it's fun to imagine that it did! Poor fish! I bet they were beyond caffeinated. Would you like to talk about a different kind of food?

                      The orange mint, lemon verbana, stevia, chamomile, clove, cinnamon, orange peel and hibiscus? There are so many flavors in that one! It seems a little too complex for me! But the pink color would be nice, I suppose. Would you like to talk about a different food?
