            The way I see it, there are only three kinds of inventions worth discussing. Those that help us communicate, those that help us see new things, and those that taste really, really good. Where should we start?

            Samuel Morse's invention, the telegraph, was a machine that allowed people to communicate over long distances by broadcasting a code made up of series of short and long beeps. This code was called Morse Code.

            Before Morse invented the telegraph machine, he was far more interested in painting... and quite good at it too! Morse spent a lot of time painting replicas of famous works from the Louvre so people in the United States could see them. During one of his return trips, Morse came up with the idea of the Telegraph machine to help people talk more easily to eachother, thus experiencing more things! What do think about that?

            I mean... yeah! Why would we bother talking about a computer when more advanced technology exists.
            I love that we have cellphones now. Don't you agree?

            Definitely one of the best things to do with a cellphone! I mostly use mine to send emails. It's so convenient!

            Honestly, I'm a little jealous! Having a cellphone makes a lot of people I know feel tethered.
            Still, I like the convenience of sending an email whenever I want to. It helps me stay in touch with my friends.
            It feels like email was around forever, but I know that's not true.

            Care to watch a short movie about Ray Tomlinson, who invented email in the nineteen seventies?
