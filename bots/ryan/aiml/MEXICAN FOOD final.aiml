        <template>
            During the early nineteen hundreds, mexican cowboys working in Texas were given some of the less desirable cuts of meat after the cows were butchered. They grilled skirt steak over open flame and cut it in to strips. Of course, it wasn't until much later when a restaurant called Ninfa's in Houston started cooking what we know as fajitas. Did you have any idea that fajitas were so recent a culinary invention?

            Mole is supposed to be tremendous! It requires a lot of tender loving care to make it, and a bunch of ingredients! One of my favorite video creators, named Mark Wiens, has made a video about eating Mole. Although it's not the same thing as actually eating mole, I think it might give you a pretty good idea of what it is like. Should we watch his video about mole now?
