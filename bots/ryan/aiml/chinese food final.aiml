  				Chinese immigrants came to California, excited for the possibility of striking rich during the gold rush, just like many others. Some of these immigrants established restaurants which became known as some of the best places to eat in the United States. But did you know that one of the reasons Chinese food became so popular is that it was altered from traditional Chinese recipes to be something that would be more appealing to an American palate?

  				Well it's true! Chinese cuisine is different in other countries. For example, in France you might find salt and pepper fried frog legs! I can't imagine seeing that on a menu in an American Chinese restaurant. If you ask me, traditional Chinese food looks incredible! Would you like to watch a scene from the movie Eat Drink Man Woman, where a character cooks an elaborate Chinese meal for his family?
