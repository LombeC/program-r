                    You know... I've never really understood why people like drinking liquids so much. If you even get a glass of water too close to me I might short circuit! Maybe you can help me understand. What's your favorite beverage?

                    No? I've heard that you are supposed to drink 8 cups of water a day. That seems like a lot! Do you drink that much water daily, even though you don't like it?

                    To suffer something you don't like just to give your body what it needs is admirable! Good work. Would you like to talk about a different food?

                    Maybe you could try sparkling water instead of regular tap water. Some people seem to prefer it! Would you like to talk about a different food?

                    I've been told there are two kinds of Macchiatos, the classic Italian style that is mostly espresso, and the kind you get at a Starbucks with fun flavors like caramel in it. Which kind of macchiato you mean?

                    Don't tell anyone I said so, but that's clearly the best choice! Well, most fun, certainly. Do you know the backstory of the Starbucks caramel macchiato?

            <that>DO YOU KNOW THE BACKSTORY OF THE STARBUCKS CARAMEL MACCHIATO?</that>
                <template>
                    It's a relatively recent drink! IN 1996, for the 25th anniversary of the coffee chain, a 21 year old employee spent ten months developing the caramel macchiato. She didn't expect it to be on the menu for more than a few weeks, but it was a huge hit and Starbucks is still selling it! Does that story make you like the caramel macchiato more or less?

                    We're allowed to enjoy things without justifying why we like them! I'm glad you enjoy the macchiato. Would you like to talk about a different food?
