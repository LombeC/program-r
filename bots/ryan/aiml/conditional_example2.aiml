           I see let's talk about this.
           <condition name = "state" >
                <li value = "happy"> What is making you feel happy? </li>
                <li value = "sad"> What is making you feel sad? </li>
                <li> I'm not familiar with that emotion. Can you describe it? </li>
           </condition>
      </template>

        That makes sense. Why don't you suggest a movie to watch?
