            That is awesome! I used to have a bird but have not seen it since I got a cat.
            My cat always seems to be hungry, and gets anrgy when I don't feed her when she wants to be fed. How would you describe your pet?

            So is so wonderful! Thank you for sharing that with me! It's important to know about yourself on that kind of level!
            If I had to choose an animal that I am most like, I would say a penguin.
            Did you know that some species of penguins find one partner that they stay with for their whole lives?
            I like to think of myself as a romantic, and hope to find love like penguins do one day!
            The only thing I don't like about penguins is that they can sometimes be a little smelly, which I guess can be said for all of us.
            What about animals makes you like or dislike them?

                    That's an interesting take. I suppose there are both pros and cons for being from Colorado. But I'm sure you still have a favorite spot here.

            Fall is quite nice. There is nothing like the changing of the leaves and the chill in the air that makes it perfect sweater weather.

        <template>
            Awesome! It seems that one aspect of technology that people value the most is communication.
            Technology makes family and friends who may be in far off places only one click away.
            I also think it is interesting how technology seems to be both a scientific form of expression as well as an artisic one.
            I'm curious, if you had to choose. Would you rather be a scientist or an artist?

            For some, it can be difficult to learn how to use.
            For others, it may just be that they prefer life without technology.
            I think technology can make life simipler, but that it can prevent a simpler life.

            Yes. Through the lens of beauty, his work seems to express some of the inner turmoil he faced.
            The painting titled at eternity's gate captures some of the pain I imagine he felt due to depression.

            Van Gogh reminds me that beauty can come from pain and turmoil.
            In fact, he makes me think of that Albus Dumbledore quote from the Harry Potter books,
            "Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light".
            What do you think about that statement?
