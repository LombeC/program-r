            I may not be able to eat human foods, but I sure do love the way they smell.
            And speaking of fragrant foods! How do you feel about chocolate chip cookies?

            To be fair, it's my favorite invention story. Which is maybe kind of strange because I don't eat food?
            I guess I just like how Ruth Graves Wakefield stumbled across such a timeless thing.
            Want to watch a video? I found a video about Ruth Graves Wakefield, the chocolate chip cookie's inventor.
