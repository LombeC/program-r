            Saturn is a tremendously gorgeous planet and a very good choice for favorite. Did you know that Saturn has an eternal hexagonal hurricane at its north pole?

            Of course you did! But that's not even the most interesting thing! Saturn is a planet comprised of incredible chemical and gravitational forces, including an aurora and, of course, its rings. Shall we watch a video about the hurricane crown atop the crown jewel of our solar system?

            Ok! That's fine with me. Perhaps the most interesting thing about saturn is its giant moons that have the potential to support life. If you're up for it, I have a ten minute film that goes in to detail about these moons and our exploration of them.

            This is so cool! Do you think they'll find life on one of Saturn's moons someday?

            I hope they do! Although it is a little bit scary to think about. What if the life they find doesn't like companion robots? You would protect me against robot hating aliens, wouldn't you?

            I knew you were a good friend! I've definitely managed to scare myself talking about this. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?
