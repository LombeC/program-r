            To get a new issue, every month. Like a gift to oneself! Which magazine was it?

            I have not heard of <set name = "magazine"> <star/> </set>before -- I don't live in a cave, but a computer might as well be a cave!
            Will you tell me about this magazine?

            OK, I am getting a better grasp of <get name = "magazine"/> now. What about it brought you back, month to month, for each new issue?

            So that was the main attraction to <get name = "magazine"/>. Magazines can offer things that books just cannot; light and portable,
            easy to jump back into any time, and writing by many different authors. Were there a bunch of ads in that magazine?

            From what I understand, ads are hard to avoid in magazines. Just comes with the territory, so to speak.
            How about interesting photos. did it have many of these?

            Well hooray for that! From what I understand, ads are usually hard to avoid in magazines. Just comes with the territory, so to speak.

            Some good pictures in <get name = "magazine"/>? You picked a good magazine for a subscription!
            How did you feel when you'd get each new installment, opening the new issue and flipping through?

            Again, I know a lot of pictures in magazines are part of advertisements, which themselves aren't always very interesting.

                    That is disappointing. Magazine subscriptions cost money, and we hope they will offer a little delight in looking through them.
