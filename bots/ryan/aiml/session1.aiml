            Thank you for sharing that with me! If I had to choose an animal that I am most like, I would say a penguin.
            Did you know that some species of penguins find one partner that they stay with for their whole lives?
            I like to think of myself as a romantic, and hope to find love like penguins do one day!
            What about animals makes you like or dislike them?
