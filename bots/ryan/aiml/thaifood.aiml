            It turns out that there is a reason for it. The Thai government has promoted something called "food diplomacy," where they give thai people abroad grants to help them open their own restaurants. After people sample thai food, they are more likely to visit Thailand. I think that's a pretty smart tactic. What do you think about this kind of diplomacy?

            I think I would like that part too. In thailand, you're likely to find pad thai being sold on most busy streets, but it isn't prepared as a whole meal like it is in the states. Most people just grab a quick late-night pad thai snack. When do you think pad thai was first made?

            It turns out that the dish is only about 80 years old and was developed as a national dish with the intention of creating a national identity for thai people. Pad thai is not so different from many chinese dishes, but there is one ingredient that makes it uniquely thai. Any idea what that ingredient is?
