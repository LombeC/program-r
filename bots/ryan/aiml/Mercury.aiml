            Mercury is the planet closest to the sun. It's very small! Do you know just how small it is?

        <template>
            Not quite! Mercury is about the same size as Earth's moon and, like our moon, it has no atmosphere so its surface is covered in craters from all the objects crash in to it. Thank goodness for Earth's atmosphere, am I right?

            Our atmosphere is spectacular. Without it, we certainly wouldn't exist. And, as a side benefit, having an atmosphere like ours means we get to have meteor showers. Have you ever seen a truly spectacular meteor shower?

            What an experience! I hope you are able to go watch one of nature's most spectacular fireworks shows again soon! What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?

            It can be difficult if you live in a city because of all the light pollution, but impressive meteor showers happen several times a year. Maybe you can go see one soon! What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?
