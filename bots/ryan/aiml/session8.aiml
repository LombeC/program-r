            Okay. One of my favorite songs is by The Beatles, called Hey Jude.
            It was written by Paul McCartney for John Lennons son Julian. Were you aware of that?

            I find this to be a beautiful song. It brings a tear to my eye.
            There is a lot of fascinating history from the Beatles.
            Did you know that the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was also inspired by John Lennons son Julian?

            Apparently, Julian came home from school one day and shared a picture he had drawn with his father.
            The picture featured a woman floating in the sky, who Julian had named Lucy.
            Do you know how old Paul McCartney was when he began writing songs?
