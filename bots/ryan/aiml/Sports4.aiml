                    I always think it is so interesting to watch old sports clips! It's like going back in time to another world! I can remember where I
                    was when I saw some small part of history being made, but more importantly I remember how I felt at that exact moment.
                    How does it make you feel to talk about hockey?

        <template>Thank you for sharing that with me! I'm glad we can talk about how we feel.
        I think we could talk with each other for hours. Do you want to talk about sports?
