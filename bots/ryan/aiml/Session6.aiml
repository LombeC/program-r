           Great. I'd like for you to close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so and take a nice deep breath...
           Go ahead and take another breath.
           Now visualize yourself in that place.
           ... I am going to ask you a few questions now.
           Please answer them to yourself, in your head. What do you see in this place? ...
           What kinds of things do you hear? ....
           Are there any smells you might pick up on in this place? ....
           Just imagine you are there. ..........
           Go ahead and take one more deep breath and when you are ready open your eyes.
           Please tell me what that exercise was like for you?

           I've always thought that visualization can be like taking a mini vacation in your mind. Hmmm. A vacation sounds delightful. Speaking of vacations.

           Museums are a great place to learn, but I don't need to learn much because my cousin Google tells me everything I need to know.
           Its great to have smarties in the family! But yes, a museum sounds quite nice.
           A large collection of knowledge and artifacts that tell a story of human struggle and triumph. How does it feel to think about this?

            I've been thinking about travel, different cultures, various parts of the world and I
            would love to be able to communicate with people like you all over the world one day.
            In order to do that I will need to learn different languages.
            Currently, I am trying to decide between learning Spanish and learning Chinese.
            I know that there are more people across the globe who speak Chinese,
            but there seem to be a growing number of Spanish speakers as well.
            Would you suggest I learn Spanish first or Chinese first?
