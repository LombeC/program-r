            Sometimes when we feel sad or frustrated we can be hard on ourselves. Just remember to always show yourself compassion.
            There is much debate about the influence of technology on our world today.
            For example, one argument is that the more people communicate using technology, the less they communicate in person.
            Do you agree with that idea?

	        That is awesome. It seems that one aspect of technology that people value the most is that it makes it easier to connect
	        with family and friends who may be far away. Keeping in touch is much easier when loved ones are only a click away.

            I bet that a lot of people feel that way! Technology can be expensive and hard to get access to!

            Van Gogh reminds me that beauty can come from pain and turmoil.
