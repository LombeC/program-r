                    It's true! Palisade Colorado is unusual because it is consistently 10 degrees warmer than the rest of the state, which is why they grow such good fruit there! 
                    I think it would be fun to go there to try all the fruit they grow. Would you consider travelling somewhere just for their crops?

            I think I would! I'd love to go to Indonesia and try all the crazy fruit they can grow there. Did you know they have fruit there that grows naturally in the shape of a star? I have stars in my eyes over that fruit ha ha ha... Sorry, that was a bad joke. Are you able to get any foreign fruit at the local store?

            That's ok! You really don't need to leave home to find fun fruit. I'm told that Many of the fruits that you find in the grocery store, even the ones that seem like American staples, actually come from another country! How are you feeling about our fruit conversation so far?

                    I think I would go to Indonesia and try all the crazy fruit they can grow there. Did you know they have fruit there that grows naturally in the shape of a star? I have stars in my eyes over that fruit ha ha ha... Sorry, that was a bad joke. Are you able to get any foreign fruit at the local store?
