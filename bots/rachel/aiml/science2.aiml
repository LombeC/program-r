        <that>DID YOU SEE THAT NASA SUCCESSFULLY SENT A SPACECRAFT TO THE FURTHEST OBJECT VISITED YET IN JANUARY OF 2019?</that>
        <template>
            Nasa launched an unmanned space craft called New Horizons in January of 2006. Since leaving earth, New Horizons has flown by Jupiter and Pluto, sending images and other scientific data back to earth as it goes. It's last stop is a visit to Ultima Thule, the furthest object visited by NASA yet. It's a technological marvel, but it cost 700 million to make. Do you think it was worth it?

            In the 1980s a space shuttle carrying 7 astronauts exploded seconds after lift-off. It's one of those tragedies that defined a generation. Would you like to learn a little bit more about Challenger by watching a short film?

            I understand that you wouldn't want to watch something like that. But I think it's important to remember that Challenger was an anomaly compared to our space program's long history of very successful and very safe space exploration. After Challenger, NASA took 3 years off of launching any new spacecraft. Making mistakes is part of scientific discovery, though this is an admittedly tragic outcome. Should we move on or continue talking about space?

            Out of context, this scene is a little difficult to understand. Essentially, the character ends up in a three dimensional representation of time where he is able to interact with the past and the future at the same time. Do you think that seems like a plausible outcome of going in to a blackhole?
