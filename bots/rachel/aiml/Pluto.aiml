            You know what I say about that? Get out of here, scientists! We like pluto. Why don't you tell me why you like Pluto?

            Pluto truly is fascinating. I think it's very neat that we have determined that Pluto would have blue skies, just like earth! Do you think you would want to visit Pluto?

            You'll have to look for frozen water while you are there. Astronomers think they have spotted water ice on Pluto, and proving that would be a huge discovery. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to Earth?

            Staying home is probably for the best! It's so cold you probably wouldn't survive the visit. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to Earth?

            It's true... Unfortunately. In 2006, scientists declared that Pluto was too small and too far away from the other planets in our solar system to be considered a true planet. They've reclassified it as a dwarf planet. How do you feel about Pluto no longer being a planet?
