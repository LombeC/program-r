            Of course you did. Everybody knows that! But. Did you know that Venus spins on its axis in the the opposite direction of most of the other planets?

            Woah! That is cool. Thanks for telling me that. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?

            Because Venus spins in the opposite direction of earth, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. How disorienting. Not that any of us will have a chance to see it because Venus' atmosphere is so poisonous. What do you say we talk about a scientific discovery a little closer to earth?

            It's true! Venus is so hot due to a rampant greenhouse gas effect, just like Earth has, but much much worse. Did you know that Venus spins on its axis in the the opposite direction of most of the other planets?
