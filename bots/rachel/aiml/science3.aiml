            Some people already have. In fact, a laboratory in South Korea has nearly perfected the science of cloning dogs. Would you like to see a video about a couple that cloned their dog after it died?

            That's fair! Not only is cloning a complex process, but even if it did work to bring back a dog their might be unexpected complications down the road. Much of an animals behaviour is based off of experiences it has throughout it's life. I found a video about why a cloned pet could still grow up to be totally different from the original animal. Shall we take a look?

            I guess it isn't all that surprising that our experiences form us, but one thing about this video stuck out to me. Did you hear him mention that cloned animals prefer to hang out with other cloned animals! Weird, right?
