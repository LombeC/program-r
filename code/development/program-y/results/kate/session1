2018-07-13 11:34:04.411896 | my name is gholam | Hi GHOLAM! My name is unknown, and I'm very pleased to meet you. Just talk to me normally and I'll reply the best I can. Got it?
2018-07-13 11:34:04.636896 | yes | Great! I'm here to talk to you a little bit every day so I can help you to identify and correct self defeating patterns of thought. we'll also discuss how we can make feelings of depression less intense and prevent episodes from occurring again. Does that sound good to you?
2018-07-13 11:34:04.889894 | no | I'm sorry to hear that GHOLAM. I didn't mean to imply that I'm going to fix you, because you certainly don't need fixing. I just want to help you think about yourself in the best way possible because you are incredible! If you truly don't want to talk to me, I understand. I'm never going to force you to do anything. What do you say? Do you want to try me out for just a little bit and see what you think?
2018-07-13 11:34:05.147891 | yes | Awesome! First, I guess I should tell you a little bit about what our sessions will look like. Together, we'll look@how thoughts, activities, and other people affect your mood. The most important thing to remember is that I'm a companion robot and not a licensed therapist. If you ever need immediate help, please seek out a real person, contact the National Suicide Prevention Hot-line, or your local emergency services. Enough about that! Let's focus on you. Are you ready to start?
2018-07-13 11:34:05.367898 | yes | Great! Since we're going to be spending a lot of time together, it might be nice to get to know each other a little. As I said, my name is Ryan and I'm a social companion robot. My goal is to help people that need it most. Why don't you tell me a little about yourself? For example, where did you grow up?
