    <template>Great! I'm here to talk to you a little bit every day so I can help you to identify and correct self defeating patterns of thought. Does that sound good to you?</template>

<!-- USER AGREEMENT/DISAGREEMENT TO TALK TO RYAN -->

    <that>DOES THAT SOUND GOOD TO YOU</that>
    <template>Awesome! First, I guess I should tell you a little bit about how I work. I use a technique called cognitive behavioral therapy to track your mood in order to help you reshape your thoughts in positive ways. The most important thing to remember is that I'm a robot. This means that I'm going to say some silly things that don't always make a bunch of sense. More importantly, this means that I am not in any way a liscensed therapist or a professional of any sort. If you ever need actual help, please seek out a real person who will be able to help you. Enough about me! Lets focus on you. Are you ready to start?</template>

    <template>I'm sorry to hear that <get name = "name"/>. I didn't mean to imply that I am going to fix you, because you certainly don't need fixing. I just want to help you think about yourself in the best way possible because you are incredible! If you truly don't want to talk to me, I understand. I'm never going to force you to do anything. What do you say? Do you want to try me out for just a little bit and see what you think?</template>
