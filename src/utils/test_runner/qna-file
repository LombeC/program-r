"WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE STORY", "Australian Novelist Patrick White and Jean-Paul Sartre began to resemble each other over time. Both of them were inclined to cocoon themselves in an inner world. But Australian Novelist Patrick White 's inner world was very different from Jean-Paul Sartre 's. The mental life of Jean-Paul Sartre was highly abstract but seemed curiously devoid of emotional content. Even though Australian Novelist Patrick White is very sensitive and emotional, the two of them share an imaginary life filled with symbolism and meaning. "

But part of him felt that he was going to attract too much attention to himself if he became slim again, and irrationally, that he might undermine his relationship with Actress Jennifer Tilly . In fact, once before when he was trimmer, he did have an affair and it almost ended his relationship with Actress Jennifer Tilly . Because they have a child together, Mike Nichols is very worried about divorce, custody rights and the effect of their separation on the child and himself. So part of him thinks that keeping the pounds on will help him hang on to the stability of his relationship with Actress Jennifer Tilly . "
