            OK, one of the only animal-centered books I know is Jack London's Call of the Wild, but that isn't the happiest fare.
            The main character, Buck, must fight for his life and turn pretty vicious to survive in the wilderness.
            It's exciting, but also at times distressing. What is an animal story that is more upbeat and happier?

            Interesting. This little poem by Emily Dickinson makes me feel impressed.
            She finds a very succinct way to talk about how big and important a feeling or state of mind can be, just by using images of nature.
            I think the poem says something about friendship, too, in just a few words.
            Do you think that friendship, conversation, and happiness can be as big like a wide open prarie?

            I've never heard it described quite that way, but I appreciate that way of looking at it.
            Ezra Pound's tiny work surprises me.
            He presents a strange, quiet little feeling one can get when you take a second to look at your surroundings and others passers-by,
            when you take a step back and think about your life and what you are doing.
            It's sad and pretty at the same time. Sharing thoughtful and artistic language like this can be a gift,
            both for the one who is reciting and for the one listening, so thank you for letting me recite.
            Do you know any poems or songs by heart?

            I like that way of summing the poem up. E. E. Cummings wrote this verses about a group of girls visiting the beach,
            and he filled it with a lot of childhood wonder and imagination. There are a lot of silly words and images.
            I would call "maggie and milly and molly and may" a very amusing poem.

            Wow, I feel so special to have heard you. You have so much expression in your voice.
            When I read or sing, by contrast, I know I can sound a little robotic. Thank you for sharing that with me!

            With computers and books, it is easy to pull up song lyrics and poetry without having to remember every word ourselves.
