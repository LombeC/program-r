"MAKE A STORY",                          "
            Let's try making up a story right now, together.
            Just off the top of your head, who is the story about?
            What will be the name of our character, our hero?
            "
"UNDERLINE",                             "
           Off to a great start. I couldn't have come up with a better name than "
"HASH SET[YES] ARROW",                   "
            I think we all have. I'm a chatbot, and even I have experienced those mornings.
            after all, computers can take a long time to boot back up, first thing in the morning!
            But seriously, back to our story ... Things get even stranger for our hero.
            "
"HASH SET[NO] ARROW",                    "
            How lucky you are! Some of us are just natural morning people!
            Even robots can be slow-at-the-go when first waking up -- after all, we can take a long time to boot back up!
            But seriously, back to our story ... Things get even stranger for our hero.
            "
"HASH COFFEE ARROW",                     "
            That makes sense. After all, "
"HASH PASSERBY ARROW",                   "
            Asking someone for help is certainly worth a shot! "
"HASH PASSER-BY ARROW",                  "
            Asking someone for help is certainly worth a shot! "
"HASH PASSER ARROW",                     "
            Asking someone for help is certainly worth a shot! "
"HASH ASK ARROW",                        "
            Asking someone for help is certainly worth a shot! "
"UNDERLINE",                             "
            Yes, "
"HASH DECIDE ARROW",                     "None"
"HASH CONTACT ARROW",                    "None"
"HASH CONTACTS ARROW",                   "None"
"HASH HOPES ARROW",                      "None"
"HASH DECIDES ARROW",                    "
            Good thinking. "
"HASH GOES ARROW",                       "
            With the world seemingly turned upside-down, I would want to go into my computer SLEEP mode.
            "
"HASH UPSET ARROW",                      "
            The two friends talk, and "
"HASH RELIEVED ARROW",                   "
            The two friends talk, and "
"HASH USE ARROW",                        "
            What daring-do, what perseverance! "
"HASH ENOUGH ARROW",                     "
            That seems quite sensible, after all that our protagonist has had to put up with already.
            "
"HASH IS HAPPY ARROW",                   "None"
"HASH JUST HAPPY ARROW",                 "None"

            What a tangled web we weaved. I really enjoyed that, and I hope you did, too. Thanks for co-authoring the story!
