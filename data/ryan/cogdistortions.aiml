        Good job! It may be easy to think that a single instance defines you, but that is never the case. You are a multifaceted person who has years of experience and life to define you. Everyone makes mistakes. Even robots like me. But you just have to realize that the moment has passed and you can forgive yourself for it. Easier said than done, right? Simply restating your negative thought "<get name = "overgeneralizationInstance"/>" in a way that says its okay to have done that is a great start. For example, if your negative thought was 'I didn't do well with that job interview so I'm therefore horrible at job interviews', you can restate that as 'I didn't do so well on that job interview, but I'll be sure to do better next time'. By changing that thought in your mind, you'll start to see how your overgeneralization is just that. Then you can start to forgive yourself. Try and restate your negative thought.
