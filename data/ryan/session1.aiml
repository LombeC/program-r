    <template>Great! I'm here to talk to you a little bit every day so I can help you to identify and correct self defeating patterns of thought. We will also discuss how we can make feelings of depression less intense and prevent episodes from occuring again. Does that sound good to you?</template>

    <template>Awesome! First, I guess I should tell you a little bit about what our sessions will look like. Together, we will look at how thoughts, activities, and other people affect your mood. The most important thing to remember is that I'm a robot. This means that I'm going to say some silly things that don't always make much sense. More importantly, this means that I am not a liscensed therapist. If you ever need immediate help, please seek out a real person, contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, or your local emergency services. Enough about the plan! Lets focus on you. Are you ready to start?</template>

    <template>I'm sorry to hear that <get name = "name"/>. I didn't mean to imply that I am going to fix you, because you certainly don't need fixing. I just want to help you think about yourself in the best way possible because you are incredible! If you truly don't want to talk to me, I understand. I'm never going to force you to do anything. What do you say? Do you want to try me out for just a little bit and see what you think?</template>

         Wow that's amazing  <get name = "name"/>! Thank you for your answers. I look forward to learning more about you as time goes on. In order for me to be the most helpful for you, there's a few other things I would like to know about you first. Do you mind answering a few questions for me? It will only take a few moments.
